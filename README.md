# Capstone Project One - Movie Application

This project aims to create a dynamic, user-friendly website that serves as a personal movie and TV show tracker. The platform will allow users to search for movies and TV shows, create and manage a personalized watchlist, rate and review titles they've seen, and mark items as "completed."

I listed basic features like Sign-up, Log-in, Log-out, View all movies, Search all movies, add to watchlist, and reviews.

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Flask, Postgresql, SQLAlchemy, Jinja

### API used:[TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
